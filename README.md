# Pokemon Starter Battle

This is a simple game of rock paper scissors, but using pokémon instead! To play, simply click on your pokémon of choice and you will automatically play a round against the computer!

## Rules

## Additional Features

- Click on the "Select Generation" tab on the top right of the screen to toggle between generations 1-5. You can change this at any time, even between rounds!
